Plackify-koha-common
====================

A set of scripts to supercharge your koha-common install with Plack

Run install.sh from your clone directory to install scripts. Use `koha-start-plack [instance]` and `koha-stop-plack [instance]` to control. 

A patch for `/etc/init.d/koha-common` is coming soon.
